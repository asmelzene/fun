Seeing uniquely created numbers is good but not necessary. It was done just because of the curiosity to see if there are too many duplicated numbers are created or not. However, this causes a performance issue for the digits greater than 7. That's why I commented out for those in the version2 (guess_the_N_digit_number_V2). so it provides a solution for an 8-digit number quickly (less than 10 seconds, sometimes 1-2 seonds. If I keep checking the unique numbers it takes forever and can't finish the calculation..).
